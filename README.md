# Nand2Tetris
This repository follows my progress in the Nand2Tetris course: https://www.nand2tetris.org/

## Description
Nand2Tetris guides you through building a computer all the way up from logic chips using hardware simulators, to running programs written in Jack, a programming language developed to run on the Hack hardware platform. If you're interested in gaining a better understanding of the inner-workings computers, I highly recommend this course.

- Hardware projects: 1-6  
- Software projects: 7-12

I used several different lanuguages for the software projects in this course. While I initially undertook this project to gain a better understanding of what goes on under the hood of a programming language, the course provided many other opportunities for growth along the way. As I worked on implementing Jack on this hardware platform, I decided to switch between programming languages for different projects. This allowed me to see how different languages handle the core concepts in each project.

## Languages

- Java:  
  - Project 6 - Assembler  
  - Project 7 - VM Translator Part I  
- Python:  
  - Project 8 - VM Translator Part II
  - Project 10 - Compiler Part I
- C:
  - Project 11 - Compiler Part II
- Jack:
  - Project 9 - Intro to the Jack Language
  - Project 12 - Operating System Classes

[Ben Eater's 8-bit Computer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) series and [Nandgame](https://nandgame.com/) were great companions to the hardware section (chapters 1-6) of the course
